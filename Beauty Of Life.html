The Eye in the middle of the shirt was created by my art teacher named Mr Russel. It has no real meaning to it, but the design ties in with the quote on the back of the shirt that says “look up and see the beauty of life.” There are also butterflies in the eye to show life's beauties. This is a white t-shirt made out of cotton and with the black designs heat press onto the shirt</p2>
