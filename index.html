	<p2 style="color:white;"><b>Beauty of Life shirt:</b>
The Eye in the middle of the shirt was created by my art teacher named Mr Russel. It has no real meaning to it, but the design ties in with the quote on the back of the shirt that says “look up and see the beauty of life.”<b>Arcane Sweatpants:</b>
The pants have white strips on the side with 2 custom designs. The first one is a ripped/destroyed star I made and the second one is just a graffiti design of my brand name.
<b>Arcane City Shorts:</b>
The shorts have a city design of San Antonio, which is where I'm from. The spider idea was from a anime called Hunter X Hunter and the AA design is my logo for my brand.
