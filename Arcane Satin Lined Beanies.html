This beanie has satin line material inside which is a soft and lustrous fabric with a shiny front. Satin lined also a slick material that allows your hair to move across its surface with minimal friction. Minimal friction = minimal breakage, which means a satin lining can help your hair stay healthy and strong. The design you see above the "Arcane" graffiti design is cherry blossom leaves across the beanie.</p2>
